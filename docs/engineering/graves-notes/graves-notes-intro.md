# Grave's Notes - Introduction

Part of the problem with any new system - not to mention a vastly complex new system composed of new systems - is that it remains undocumented outside of those people (or that person) creating it until someone tries to write it all down. 

Our Engineering Lead, GraveCat (Matt) is learning wide swathes of the various systems and documenting them all for himself, so it seemed as good a time as ever to try and capture that and share it with the team. 

We will try to upload his notes regularly to the [Unsorted Notes section](./graves-notes-unsorted.md) and then parse them out and group them logically throughout the rest of the documentation as time goes on.
